# This whole thing is just a hot mess now.
    should've planned this :>

# Do something about the fact that most of functions for plans/users look exactly the same
    but idk if it makes sense to do it after the fact

# Generally too much code dupe
    can make some decorator/helper functions

# Don't really like the splitting I did with controllers/routes
    it is hard to find what is where

# Test. Cookies especially
    i thing it maybe a bit too much for how small this thing is
