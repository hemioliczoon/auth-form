## Migrate from express to nextjs thing 
Put api routes into ./pages/api and such

## Validate user input on the backend

## Clean up scss files
1. Put colors I use inside variables
2. Put variables and mixins in one file and import them

## Write README

## Honestly why I'm doing this in nextjs and not using half of the nextjs stuff
